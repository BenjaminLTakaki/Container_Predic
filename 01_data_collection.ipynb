    "# Data Collection for Europe Base Port Container Price Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on gathering all the raw data needed for our 1-week ahead container price forecasting project. We will collect data from three different sources and save it for later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is data collection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection is the first step in any data science project. It involves gathering raw information from various sources like files, databases, or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces, which are ways for programs to talk to each other over the internet). Think of it like gathering ingredients before cooking a meal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are we predicting?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target**: Europe Base Port container prices (1 week ahead)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Ports Definition**: Average shipping cost for a 40-foot container from Shanghai/China to major European ports including Rotterdam (Netherlands), Hamburg (Germany), London (UK), and Antwerp (Belgium).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why these ports**: These represent the main entry points for Asian goods into Europe and provide a standard benchmark for European route pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (local CSV file) - Main price data\n",
    "2. Oil prices (from Yahoo Finance API Hopefully) - Cost factor affecting shipping / (Not working looking for work around)\n",
    "3. Geopolitical disruption data (from GDELT via BigQuery) - Black swan event indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We use GDELT data exported from Google BigQuery for historical coverage (2018-2025). This provides weekly disruption metrics including conflict events, severe incidents, and sentiment analysis for shipping-critical regions."
