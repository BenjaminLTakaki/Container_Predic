The feature importance plot is particularly insightful, showing which features contribute most to the model's predictions. As expected, the `price_lag_1` is the most important feature, confirming the strong autocorrelation in the series. Other lags and rolling window features also show significant importance, validating our feature engineering approach."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the evaluation metrics, the **XGBoost model** is the best-performing model, achieving the lowest MAE, RMSE, and MAPE. This is likely due to its ability to capture the complex, non-linear interactions between the engineered features, which a classical model like SARIMA cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:** The current best model is highly dependent on the engineered features, particularly the recent lags of the price itself. This means its longer-term forecasting ability might be limited. Furthermore, it does not explicitly account for the hierarchical nature of the time series data or exogenous shocks that are not captured in the provided features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Improvements:**\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** A more rigorous hyperparameter tuning process (e.g., using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV with time-series cross-validation) could further improve the XGBoost model's performance.\n",
    "2. **Advanced Models:** Exploring deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers could capture more complex temporal dependencies.\n",
    "3. **Exogenous Variables:** Incorporating a wider range of exogenous variables, such as macroeconomic indicators, port-specific events, or sentiment analysis from geopolitical news, could significantly enhance predictive accuracy."
